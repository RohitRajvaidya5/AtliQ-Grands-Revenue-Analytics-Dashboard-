# AtliQ Grands Revenue Analytics Dashboard  

## 📖 Project Overview  
AtliQ Grands is a chain of luxury five-star hotels in India with over 20 years of experience in the hospitality industry. Recently, they have been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category due to strategic competition and ineffective management decisions.  

To regain their market position, AtliQ Grands decided to leverage **Business and Data Intelligence**. Since they lack an in-house data analytics team, they hired a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and deliver actionable insights.  

This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into their revenue performance and key metrics to aid in better decision-making.
